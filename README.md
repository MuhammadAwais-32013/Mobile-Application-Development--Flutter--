# MAD (Mobile Application Development) — CS 8th Semester

This repository contains coursework, labs and example Flutter projects for the Mobile Application Development (MAD) subject taught in the CS 8th semester. All MAD-related work for the course will be maintained here.

## Purpose

- Central place to store class exercises, lab projects, and supporting documentation for the MAD course.
- Each class or lab is kept in its own folder (for example: `class_03/`, `class_04/`, `fmclass_2/`, ...).

## Current contents

- Multiple Flutter projects organized by class folders (see top-level directories).
- Example completed demo: `fmclass_2` — Attendance Tracker using Provider (`lib/models`, `lib/widgets`, `lib/main.dart`).

## What will be maintained here

- Lab exercises and small projects from lectures and practicals.
- Source code, documentation, and any sample assets needed for the MAD course.
- Optional additions: tests, CI workflows, persistence examples, and export utilities.

## How to run the `fmclass_2` Attendance demo locally

1. Change into the project folder:

```bash
cd fmclass_2
```

2. Fetch dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the app (choose a device/emulator or run on web):

```bash
flutter run
```

## Contributing

- Create an issue describing the feature or bug.
- Submit a branch and a pull request. Add tests where appropriate.

## License & Author

- Add a `LICENSE` file at the repository root to make licensing explicit.
- Repository owner / maintainer: (replace with your name)

If you want, I can add a short index file that lists each class folder and a one-line description for quick navigation.
